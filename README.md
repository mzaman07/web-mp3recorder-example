# web-mp3recorder-example
Example of using the CreateMediaStreamSource and Navigation.getMedia APIs in modern browsers. Converts raw microphone inputs into mp3 via the browser with help from [lame.js](https://github.com/zhuker/lamejs). This is only an example and anything beyond it should consider alternatives like encoding the audio on a server.
